# Hi there üëã

Note: [Click here](https://github.com/ThatsNiceGuy/ThatsNiceGuy/releases) to see some stuff I release (or reupload) but am too lazy to put elsewhere.

New project: [make_and_flash_logo](https://github.com/ThatsNiceGuy/make_and_flash_logo)

## Intro
My name is Ismael and on the Internet I like to go by ThatsNiceGuy.

I like to mess with software, hardware and sometimes audio equipment.

Big Apple fan but not a blind "sheep" as I like many other devices and platforms, one good example being my favorite experimentation phone which is an LG V30+ US998 running a somewhat old build of DerpFest 10.

I also have some knowledge of Unix-like systems and will know how to get around on pretty much any OS (but just don't make me use i3)

Yae Sakura is best waifu imo

## Favorite things
OS: macOS\
Mobile OS: idk android and iOS are both bad in different ways\
Phone: Will have to be my daily driver iPhone X or the ROG Phone 5\
Tablet: iPad Pro 11" 2020\
Headphones: AirPods Pro\
Smartwatch: idk i kinda want a Series 6/4
