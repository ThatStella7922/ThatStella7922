## Intro
My name is Ismael and on the Internet I like to go by ThatsNiceGuy.

I like to mess with software, hardware and sometimes audio equipment.

Big Apple fan but not a blind "sheep" as I like many other devices and platforms, one good example being my experimentation phone which is a OnePlus 6T (global variant) that dualboots LineageOS 17.1 (android 10) and Windows 10 ARM with [an experimental UEFI](https://github.com/edk2-porting/edk2-sdm845).

I also have some knowledge of Unix-like systems and will know how to get around on pretty much any OS (but just don't make me use i3)

Yae Sakura is best waifu
