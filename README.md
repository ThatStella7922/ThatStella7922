## Intro
My name is Ismael and on the Internet I like to go by ThatsNiceGuy.

I like to mess with software, hardware and sometimes audio equipment.

Big Apple fan but not a blind "sheep" as I like many other devices and platforms, one good example being my experimentation phone which is a OnePlus 6T (global variant) that dualboots Pixel Experience (Android 11) and Windows 10 ARM with an experimental UEFI.

I also have some knowledge of Unix-like systems and will know how to get around on pretty much any OS (but just don't make me use i3)

Yae Sakura is best waifu

You can also DM me on Discord, I'm in a few big public servers like the Linus Tech Tips server, the Honkai Impact and Genshin servers, the r/Hackintosh Paradise server, some RTX 3080 stock checker discord servers, and a few more.
