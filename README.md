# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Intro
My name is Ismael and on the Internet I like to go by ThatsNiceGuy.

I like to mess with software, hardware and sometimes audio equipment.

Big Apple fan but not a blind "sheep" as I like many other devices and platforms, one good example being my favorite experimentation phone which is an LG V30+ US998 running a somewhat old build of DerpFest 10.

I also have some knowledge of Unix-like systems and will know how to get around on pretty much any OS.

Yae Sakura is best waifu imo
